# AB_Testing

## Business Problem 
Facebook introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing "maximum bidding" type of bidding.
One of our clients, say X, decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if average bidding converts more than maximum bidding. 

## AB TEST 
In this A/B test, X randomly divides its target audience into two groups of equal size.
Control and Test group.
A Facebook ad campaign with "maximum bidding" is served to "Control Group" and another campaign with "average bidding" is served to "Test Group". 

## Customer Journey
User sees an ad (Impression)
The user clicks on the website link in the ad (Website Click)
User searches the website (Search)
User views details of a product (View Content)
User adds product to cart (Add to Cart) 
User buys product (Purchase) 

## Aim
The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and X is now waiting for you to analyse the results of this A/B test.
The ultimate measure of success for X is Purchase.
That's why you should focus on the purchase metric for statistical testing. 

## Questions to Answer
1- How would you describe the hypothesis of this A/B test?
2- Can we draw statistically significant results? 
3- Which test did you use? Why?
4- Based on your answer to question 2, what is your advice to the customer?
